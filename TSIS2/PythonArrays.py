# Create an array containing car names:
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
# Get the value of the first array item:
x = cars[0]
# Modify the value of the first array item:
cars[0] = "Toyota"
# Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array).
x = len(cars)
# Print each item in the cars array:
for x in cars:
  print(x)
# Add one more element to the cars array:
cars.append("Honda")
